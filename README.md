# Deep Learning Model Performance Report

## Overview
Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, seeks to identify successful applicants for funding using machine learning and neural networks. They provide a dataset of over 34,000 organizations that received funding. The goal is to create a binary classifier using TensorFlow, predicting an organization's success if funded by Alphabet Soup. After the initial model is set up, optimize the model using various methods to achieve a predictive accuracy above 75%.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
  The target variables of the model are data in the column of IS_SUCCESSFUL, which indicates if the money was used effectively
- What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  Data in the other columns other than the target variable are features, such as APPLICATION_TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, etc.
- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

 -What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
